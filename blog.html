        <p> After a long duration of planning, coordinating, building, and other agonizing processes, the First Grand Melee finally comes to an end.<br> This was our first successful event, and our first event held in Novetus.<br> Even though it didn't go perfectly, it was still a blast seeing people blow each other up for three hours over two days. (Using deprecated systems on a hardly-stable engine with people connecting from all around the world to a single proxy should obviously result in some errors.) 
           <br> I am also very happy to have had my hat, the Anachronist Apotheosis, used as the prize.<br> I would like to once again give my personal congratulations to the three winners, and a thank you to everyone who played, and those who intended to play but couldn't. <br>
            And to those who couldn't- do not feel too bad about missing this event, there is still more to come, and more to earn! </p>
            <p>The three winners has received the Anachronist Apotheosis.</p>

        <p>Remember that time we got bored, stole the Clockwork-08 satellite, and launched it into space, causing a chain reaction of events that resulted in a murderous robot invading the discord server, turning it into a Subspace fiefdom, and subjecting everyone to its will? No? That was before you joined?
            Well don't worry! The infamous Atropos XR has decided to explain everything to everyone in a long, drawn out, but moderately exciting story! 
            It even has it's own channel- #roblogs-lore! Here, you can learn the well-kept stories of certain characters that were lost to Roblox history.
            Even though the story of Roblogs has been caught up so far, keep an eye on the channel- Atropos claims it has made some big plans.</p>

        <p>We've decided to put Ro-Bits on sale, so you can buy them for Robux directly from us!
        </p>
<p>This is because most of the things in the <a href="robits-store.html">Ro-Bits store</a> are very expensive, and there are not that 
many people who have that many Ro-Bits, so you can't purchase them from anyone.</p>
        <p><img src="images/robitscentralbank.png" style="height: 200px;"></p>
                
            <p>However, if you want to buy smaller amounts of Ro-Bits, you still have to rely on the ones the individual sellers provides.</p>

        <p>I figured the site needed a revamp, since it has been a few months since the website last had a new look.</p>
        <p>I thought that it might be cool to have a 2006-07 themed website, so I went for that look. As you might've noticed, the blog
            page has also been changed.

        <p>Hey there, fellow Roblogsian!<br>
            As you might have noticed, I've made another site revamp! I have been spending the past few days completely remaking the site from the bottom up, since the files was very messy, and I also had to redo a lot of the code, since there was a ton of beginner mistakes, and bad code in generel. <br>
            Go take a look around the site, and let me know what you think!
            <br> Remember to post your feedback and suggestions to the forums if you have any!

        <p>Hey there, fellow Roblogsian!

            Today it's the 12. October! <br>
        That means that Roblogs has officially been up for 1 month! Huzzah!
    <br>I would also like to thank insaneshane, for being such a great business partner! And of course, the whole community! Roblogs wouldn't be the same without you!</p>

        <p>To the first 20 users, I decided to make a @Jr. User role for them on the Discord Server. <br>

            And everybody who gets the @Jr. User role, will also be displayed on a page, here on the website very soon! <br>
            
            And thank you all for being a part of this project!</p>
